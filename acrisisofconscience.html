            soldiers of the Continental Army would be questioning their war with Britain at this moment.
            Indeed, the horrible costs of war—fatherless children, urban destruction and suffocating debts—warrant a critical analysis into the justifications of war.
            If a war is to be just, then the reasons for its waging must be just. A war waged for profit, resources or the protection of the interests of a few fail to render it moral. In the case of the Revolutionary War, the colonists were in error for their revolt against the Motherland.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A common justification for the Revolution was the economic strangulation by British laws and taxes. This assertion is baseless.
            Although Britain did impose laws such as the Proclamation of 1763, and taxes such as the Townshend Acts, a closer look reveals these actions as far from tyranny. After Britain won the Seven Years War—a war, one must consider, that
            removed French presence—attempts to control the colonies was the result of huge war debts (Boyer et al. 82). These attempts, however, in general suffered from “inefficiency, loopholes, and numerous opportunities for corruption” that stopped duties and taxes from significantly inhibiting the “colonists’
            pursuit of their own economic and social interests” (Wood 5). And although the Proclamation of 1763 was ineffective,
            its intention was the suppression of violence in North America (Wood 22). Britain's policies were not that of a tyrannical dictatorship.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Another dominant reasoning behind the revolt was the blood lust of the British redcoats. Most would point to the Boston Massacre, where British soldiers supposedly fired upon a crowd of Patriots without provocation (Boyer et al. 83).
            But this is far from the truth. The crowd of ropemakers, in retaliation to fear of losing their jobs, incited the soldiers to fire (Zinn 67). However, this is not to say that the British military was as peaceful as possible, but neither were the colonists.
            For example, after a humiliating retreat during the war, squads of Patriot soldiers prowled the streets of New York, “breaking into houses and taking whatever they wanted” (McCullough 202). The British military was not an oppressive force against the colonists.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“The cause of America is,” Thomas Paine wrote in Common Sense, “in a great measure, the cause of all mankind.” If indeed the Revolutionary war was made for ideals—the ideals of liberty, people’s rule and equality—then the Founding Father’s policies after separation suggests
            that these notions were simply forgotten. The majority of persons in North America—Native Americans, African-Americans, women—did not gain liberty nor representation; in fact, their situation did not improve after the war (Zinn 91).
            While this largely reflects society’s morals at the time (Boyer et al. 177), only in Pennsylvania could every white taxpayer vote, as the rest of the states had property requirements for suffrage (Wells, Postgate 699).
            Furthermore, seven years after the words of “Congress shall make no law… abridging the freedom of speech…” entered the Constitution, the Founding Fathers violated this dictum through the Sedition Act of 1798, which illegalized “false, scandalous and malicious” words against the government (Zinn 100).
            It is clear through the actions of the leaders of the Revolution that their war was not made for ideals, and therefore, their war was not justified.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The lack of truly oppressive economic policies, absence of atrocities committed by the British, and the questionable morals of the Founding Fathers after victory, fails to render the Revolutionary War a justified war. The horrific price for wars requires the most extreme of circumstances. If the colonists were under threat of economic or bodily injury, then their revolt could be considered moral.
                But this is not the case. As such, the colonists were morally remiss for their insurrection against British authority.</p>
