            <img src="snow.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" width="660" height="445" alt="dark street"><br>
            <p><strong>pt. 1    -   I’m God</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He parked his van, got his briefcase, and began to walk down the street. The usual crunch crunch from treading on snow was muted by the special covering on his shoes; his clothes were the color of midnight; and black gloves warmed his fingers.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;His heart pounded.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She trudged through the snow. The wind bit at her face, as if it were angry at her for being out this late. She was wrapped tightly by a parka and scarf, but she still shivered. It was late, and she just wanted to get home from after work.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The street was long and narrow. The light posts casted her shadow when she passed them. She checked her phone, and saw that she had missed a call from an unknown number. She called the number, putting the phone between her ear and her blonde hair. When the number picked up, her <em>Hello, who is this?</em> was answered by <em>Do you want to play?</em> Alarmed, she hung up and stopped walking.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She looked over her shoulder.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This morning, when Detective James Marshall was drinking his first cup of coffee, he thought he was close to making an arrest in the Anna Parker murder case. But now, after the sun had set and he was sipping on his fourth cup, he was at square one: interviewing witnesses, canvassing the crime scene, and reviewing similar crimes in recent history.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, the list of cases that resembled Anna’s homicide was short, for Marshall had never seen anything like it: Anna’s blood had been drained; her nails, hair, and vulva removed; much of her skin was missing; and she was found hanging upside from her ankles at the town’s Shell station.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the FBI’s database, he found only two crimes in the past three years which a comparison could be made. The first was with a little girl who had been dismembered and placed in a dumpster behind a bar. The second was a college student who found in a completely scorched car. (Upon investigation, it was determined that the student was most likely burned alive, and he was missing a hand.)<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately for Marshall, the perpetrator of the girl’s death had been killed in prison last year. For the other case, the college student’s death was unsolved, and the identity of the college student was not even known. (The police only assumed that he was a college student because university-level physics and mathematics textbooks were discovered several hundred feet from the car.)<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Marshall crushed his Styrofoam cup in frustration and got up from his desk. He decided that he needed a walk around the block to clear his head. Leaving his office, he passed several other cops at their desks, all working on the Anna murder.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Normally the department would not pay for this much overtime, but this case was not a normal case: it was a red ball, a high-profile crime with lots of public interest. Anna Parker was pretty, white, and married to a wealthy lawyer. This was not the type of person to be affected by crime. But she was. Brutally. Or, as his partner described it, it was a “clusterfuck and a shitstorm.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He put on his trench coat, and went outside. Marshall had not walked ten feet from the police headquarters before he saw something peculiar in the snow. A piece of notebook paper was on the ground, with a lock of brown hair next to it. He picked up the paper. A message was scribbled in crayon.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<em>My parent said it was OK. Do u want to play? They said you dont half to hide.</em></p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<em>What the fuck.</em>Marshall looked around, but only saw a few cars in the police parking lot. He crumpled up the paper and put it in his pocket. He put the hair in an evidence bag that he happened to have in his coat.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Taking a deep breath, he checked his phone. His partner had texted him about another one of their cases, an armed robbery which had gone awry. This was just too much for Marshall, and he decided to call it a night.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He went back to his office to gather his notes and briefcase. When he went to turn off his computer, the FBI database was still on the screen, and the case file was on the little girl who was murdered. As a part of the casefile, there was a picture of her before the murder. She was only eight years old, with blue eyes, freckles, and brown hair.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There were a second track of footsteps in the snow behind her. She sprinted to her house.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Panting, she unlocked the door, and entered her bungalow. The warmth enveloped her, and she took off her parka and scarf. She placed her purse on the kitchen table and thought about what she should do. Should I call Travis? But what would he do? Should I call the police? If I did, what would I tell them? That I thought someone was following me because I saw a second set of footprints behind me? Thankfully, her son was at his dad’s house.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Exasperated, she plopped down on the couch and turned on the TV. The anchorman was talking about a sex scandal in the White House. Over the narration of the anchorman, there was a creak in the floorboards.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Before she could turn her head, a rag violently covered her mouth and she felt something cold against her neck. It was a knife. The man behind her laughed as she started screaming and shaking her head. Tears started to roll down her face.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The man turned her head to face himself. Her eyes widened when she saw him. He was wearing lipstick, smeared eye shadow, and blonde hair that was taped onto the sides of his head. Under his right eye, “I’m God” was written in sharpie. And then she stopped struggling. Her head slumped forward.</p>
            <p><strong>pt. 2   -   do you want to play?</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He unlocked the storage unit, and rolled up the door. Inside, the walls were covered with mirrors. Except for one mirror on the ceiling, every one was broken and taped together. Dried blood formed a carpet on the cement ground. The storage unit was mostly empty, save for a rotting mattress in the middle of the room.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When he carried her to the bed, he had to step over several bathroom scales which were scattered on the floor. He laid her gingerly down on the mattress, put the rag again to her face, and started to remove his clothing.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was after midnight, but Marshall was too wired to fall asleep. Instead of lying awake in bed, he went downstairs to his computer. He browsed Facebook, read a few headlines on Google News, and then checked his email. Nothing was exciting until he saw the third new email, as it was from the Maine State Crime Lab. The DNA results from a tube of mascara which was found several miles from Anna’s body were in.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Although the tube was muddied, some blood was found on it. After analysis, the blood was matched to Ed Shaw, Jr., a convicted sex offender who was released three years ago on good behavior. At the end of the email the lab technician wrote that he wishes Marshall “the best of luck catching the fucker who did this.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This was good news. Really good news. Marshall’s heart pounded in his chest, as if he was actually chasing after Mr. Shaw.  Marshall always said that following a promising lead was like “driving a girl when you knew she wanted to smash when you got home.”<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Marshall checked the National Sex Offender Registry to see Shaw’s last known residence. Then his heart sank: Shaw committed suicide last year by an acetaminophen overdose.<br>
               &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He slammed his fist onto his desk in anger, and then put his face into his hands.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He was completely naked, and moved toward her unconscious body.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After the disappointment of the Shaw lead, Marshall went to bed. But he woke up, like most nights, after only a few hours. He turned to his side, checked his phone, and put it down after he saw that he didn’t have any notifications.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Technically, it was Saturday, which meant he was supposed to have dinner with Rachel tonight. But he was not sure if she’ll show up—last time she was late by a half-hour. Should I remind her? But why should he? If she didn’t care enough to remember their date, should he really be emotionally involved with her? He picked up his phone again, and looked at their messages, debating whether or not to text her.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They weren’t dating, but they weren’t friends. They weren’t even “friends with benefits,” because she said they weren’t. They weren’t anything, but Marshall felt like he wasn’t anything.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He tried to get his mind off her by thinking about work (sometimes it was the other way around, with him thinking about her to get his mind off work), so he thought about the message he found today. He had seen pranks before: one time a teenager sent him a ransom note about a recently missing child. The teenager wrote the note just for the hell of it, and the child turned up a few days later at her mother’s house. But this was different. It didn’t seem to be like a prank. And how would anyone know he would be outside at that moment?<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He turned to his alarm clock on his desk. It was 3:04 A.M.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He took off her clothes, and gave her injection of epinephrine. He wanted her to be awake for this.</p>
            <p><strong>pt 3.  -   memory lane</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Screams. Why are you doing this. Please fucking stop. Water. Showers and lockers. No one else is here. Why why why why.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dont tell anyone dont fucking tell anyone if you do I swear to God. God.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What did he do I don’t understand. It burns and hurts so bad where he did it. Fuck. I didnt ask him to do it and just went onto me and forced it in.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Why?<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; He told me never tell no one but I just cant keep it inside I just cant I need to tell someone it burns inside of me so bad please please if only someone knew they could help me help me. Please can you help me? Im trapped.</p>
            <p><strong>pt. 4  -   am i beautiful</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She violently escaped from her chemically-induced slumber. She kicked, thrashed her head, and yanked at her handcuffs. But it was to no avail.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He was standing near the storage-unit wall, looking at himself in one of the hundreds of mirrors. To her horror, he was wearing her clothes: black leggings and a blouse with pink flowers on it. She looked down at what she was wearing. It was a navy suit with a gold tie. It was baggy and made her feel like a child. This made her heart drop. He had taken off her clothes.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Oh, you’re awake? Don’t mind me, I’m just getting ready for tonight. What do you think?” He turned to face her as he said this. His face was blanketed with makeup: thick foundation, blush, heavy eye shadow, highlighter, and eyelash extensions.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She started to shake. She had no idea what he was doing. She looked around at the room, disturbed at all of the broken mirrors and bathroom scales on the ground.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Don’t you think I’m beautiful? I spent so much time trying to make myself look good!”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;His voice turned to a high-pitch shrill. She couldn’t muster a response.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“God dammit honey! Answer me!” His voice was still sharp, like that of a six-year old throwing a tantrum. After a few seconds of her not replying, he continued.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Very well, give me the silent treatment. I see how it is. Two can play that game, you know? Also, you’ll won’t be getting anything tonight if you keep it up.” He adjusted his blouse, as if there was something to adjust on his chest. He resumed applying mascara, humming while doing it.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For the first time, she was able to view her captor. He was around 5’9’’, had a lean build, and was wearing a blonde wig, the same color as her own hair. She blinked. She couldn’t believe that this happening, that she was being held by some fucker dressed up as a woman. She then realized what he was doing: he wanted to be her. She blinked again.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then he stopped. He asked if she was ready to go out. She didn’t know how to respond, so she went with her gut reaction.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You’re a sick fuck!”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Instantly, his face went sour. He ran to her, pulling out a knife. He screamed at her, saying how dare her say something like that. He held the knife to her throat. It was cold against her skin.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With a flick of his wrist, he could end her life; all of her hopes, fears, and dreams would disappear in moments; her baby boy would never see her again; and she would never be able to tell the world what happened. She started to cry. He started to laugh.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“That’s what I thought.” He removed the knife and put the rag to her face again.</p>
            <p><strong>pt. 4   -  6ix 6ix 6ix / / devils</strong></p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He ran around the room, rambling incoherently. Occasionally, he would stop and punch a mirror.<br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;beauty depends on the eye<br>
            I hate myself and want&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to die<br>
            Im not &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;good enough.<br>
            Does this look good? No it doesNT.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fuck. Fuck my life.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fuck you.<br>
            Im not good enough.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 		I have trouble sleeping at	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	night.<br>
            IF only &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;		I could 	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	be someone else.<br></p>
            <p><strong>pt. 5  -  wine and dine</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was 8:37. They were supposed to have dinner at 8:30. For the past ten minutes, Marshall had obsessively checked his phone, both for the time and to see if she’d texted him (she hadn’t). He felt foolish sitting there alone. He almost wanted to tell the nearby-diners that he wasn’t going to dinner by himself but that he was waiting for someone.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He started to tell himself a lie for why she was late. She had just rear-ended someone, and she was now filling out the insurance information. No, that’s not it. She was at the hospital, seeing her grandmother after a major surgery. No, even better, she was a surgeon who was performing a life-saving operation on a patient.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Every couple of minutes the waiter would come by and check to see if he wanted to order, but each time Marshall would say he was waiting for someone. By now he had drank all of his water, and he didn’t want to ask for more because he thought it would be weird since he hadn’t ordered anything yet. He also wanted to wait until the food came to order wine.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And then, like day out of darkness, Rachel came. She was wearing a tight-fitting black dress, and her hips swayed as she walked. Marshall had seen her many times before, but still his mouth almost dropped.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They hugged when she reached his table. She smelled like Rose d'Arabie. It wafted into his nose, grabbing his shirt with two hands and pulled him in closer, tempting him, making him want to get that smell on him.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She said she was extremely sorry for being late, that she just got done with work. She then said she was famished. He said he was too.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The restaurant was dimly lit, and most of the other diners were either wearing suits or formal dresses. The table featured a rose in a vase. Rihanna played in the background. She said that she liked the music.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Rachel began talking about work, which they usually did when they had dinner. Marshall had trouble keeping eye contact with her. He played with the salt and pepper on the table. Their conversation was going nowhere, and her words were background noise.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When her eyelids opened and her consciousness flowed back in, she was sitting in a chair. He was at a chair across from her, and a table was between them. The table had a dining cloth on it, with a candle, rose petals, and two (full) wine glasses. He was still wearing her clothes. She was wearing blue jeans and a yellow polo. They were still in the storage-unit, and there were still hundreds of shattered mirrors on the walls. They were obviously on a date, hence the table set-up and why he was “getting ready” earlier.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What horrified her was her complete isolation from the rest of the world; not only was she unable to communicate with anyone, she had no idea what time it was, whether it was day or night, whether it was the same day as when she was kidnapped or several days later. She also had no idea where she was. She was on an deserted island with a psychopath. She wanted to cry, except he was there, and she didn’t want the rag to her face again. Instead, she told herself that it would be over soon, that someone was looking for by now. Maybe she was put on a missing persons list.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Some pop music played in the background. She could not tell where from, though. He said that he liked the music. He moved his head side-to-side in unison with the song.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Sing with me, why don’t you? I love to hear your voice honey.” He said.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Of course. You go first.” She knew better now; she knew to play along.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He cleared his throat, and began to sing the song:<br>
            <p class="text-center">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“When the sun shines, we shine together<br>
            Told you I'll be here forever”</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He motioned for her to join, and she reluctantly complied.</p>
            <p class="text-center">“Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
                Know that we still have each other<br>
            You can stand under my umbrella<br>
            You can stand under my umbrella”</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“It’s such a beautiful song honey, isn’t it? I think it played the night we first met.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yes, yes it is.” She felt extremely uncomfortable at this remark.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She was now sure that there was no way he was going to let her go. But what did he want from her? Sex? If he did, why didn’t he try anything yet? Did he really kidnap her just to dress up like her? What was he getting out of it? And why hasn’t anyone found her yet? He interrupted her reverie by speaking.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Oh good, our food is ready! Aren’t you hungry honey?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She nodded yes. He promptly rose and went into a corner. He opened up a few boxes that she hadn’t noticed before and was pouring something into bowls. He returned after a few seconds with their meal. He laid it down on the table for them.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Two bowls of mac-n-cheese. Except it was not cooked. He rubbed his hands together, and began using his fingers to scoop up the noodles, eating them with a crunch crunch. He put the cheese powder that came with it and put it in his wine and then drank it. She almost gagged.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She had a dilemma now: either eat the mac-n-cheese and risk ingesting drugs he put into it, or not eat it and risk him putting the rag to her face. She then decided that she had to escape somehow, and that she would just need to stall until she made her move.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the same corner where he went for the mac-n-cheese, she saw a rag on a suitcase. That must be it. If she were able to distract him and then knock him out with the rag, she would have hours to get away from him and call the police. She stared at him, who had macaroni noodles falling out of his mouth and cheese powder on his lips.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Hey honey, do you want to play a game of hide and seek?” She asked.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; He said yes. She told him that she would hide first. He said “okay,” and closed his eyes.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She grabbed the wine glass and smashed it on his head. He was dazed, and did not react for a second. She then dashed for the rag, hoping she was quicker than him. She wasn’t.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Although he had been incapacitated for a second, he caught up with her before she had made it the twenty feet to the corner of the storage unit. He grabbed her and threw her on the ground. She shrieked and commenced to sob. He cursed her and placed his hands around her throat. She struggled and tried biting his hands. He tightened his grip, and her life drained away.</p>
            <p class="text-center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He bit her neck; she dug her nails into his back; perspiration dripped from him onto her. They were one flesh. For once Marshall felt powerful.</p>
            <p class="text-center"><strong>pt. 6  -  new red ball</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Detective Marshall awoke to his phone buzzing. Whenever that happened, it was going to bad day, for it meant another red ball. He begrudgingly answered it. It was his partner. He got up and started getting ready for work. Rachel was still asleep.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As he drove through the long and narrow street to meet his partner at the crime scene, he wondered if Rachel was up by now. After a few wrong turns, he finally made it to his destination. He got out of his unmarked car, dipped under the yellow police tape that wrapped around the house, and saw his partner talking to an older woman, most likely a neighbor.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Detective Dave Shepard was a brawny man, an atavism to his days as Marine rifleman. He was, at times, brutally intense: he would attack a case with an inner-fire most cops did not have, and also was investigated multiple times for excessive use-of-force complaints.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Once Dave saw Marshall, he thanked the woman for her time and walked over to Marshall, who was surveying the house. Dave briefed him on the case.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Natasha Mia went missing two days ago, after her ex-boyfriend came by to drop off her son. She is twenty-six years old and did not have a history of leaving without notifying anyone. She had a steady job as a bartender. She didn’t have car, so it’s unlikely she drove off. The backdoor was found to be busted open.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Do you think it’s the same guy who hung Anna Parker?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Marshall yawned before he answered. “If we find Natasha’s body stretched across some park bench, then yes.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dave cursed their luck. “This is exactly what we need. The department is already on our ass about all the overtime we clocked for Parker, now this shit.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah, well, if they want this fucking red ball solved they’re gonna have to pay for it. What else have you gathered so far?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Not much. Some woman heard screaming early this morning, but I doubt that it’s related.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Let’s keep canvassing, alright?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Dave agreed. They both walked with another plainclothes officer around the neighborhood, hoping to find something that the other dozen cops hadn’t.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After a few hours, they returned without a lead nor an idea of where to start. Dave said he was going to continue talking to neighbors. Marshall went to his office to do some research.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;His heart skipped beat when he saw his desk. On it, there was a note:</p>
            <p class="text-center"><em>Honey, do I look pretty tonight?</em></p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Next to the note was a lock of blonde hair. He called a friend.</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sophia analyzed the videotape. It showed, in high-definition, a man in a blouse entering, putting the note and hair in his office, and exiting. What the fuck. Neither could believe their eyes.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Have you seen anything like this?” She asked.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“No. No criminal has ever made it inside my office before.”<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I don’t know if I can much out of this. It doesn’t show his face.” Sophia was good, but not that good. Marshall met her at a training last year and they remained close friends ever since.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; “Hopefully something will come up in the police canvas.” Sophia said.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It did. A fingerprint on the fire escape that the suspect used to enter the building. The next day they had a match. Luke Gosling. Thirty-three years old. He had a couple of petty crimes on his rap sheet. All they needed was a warrant and they could bring him into the station.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Marshall expressed his concerns to Dave. Solving a case was never this easy. It almost made Marshall suspicious.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Do you think this is the guy who’s behind everything?” Dave asked.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“It doesn’t matter if it’s the fucking guy or not. We need to get an arrest soon. He was convicted of indecent exposure a few years ago, and it wouldn’t take much stretching to get a jury think he’s the fucker who did it.”<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Alright. Tomorrow morning we can get a search warrant, and maybe next week we can can bag him.”<br></p>
            <p class="text-center">*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; He anxiously called his friend.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; “You sure you can get me in tomorrow?”<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; “Yes, I already fucking told you. Just don’t hurt anyone. I’ll lose my job if you do.”</p>
            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;*</p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When he got home, she wasn’t there. Rachel said she would be at the house all day. Normally Marshall would not be worried, but as he walked to his computer all of their pictures together were gone. This unnerved him, so he called her.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Where did you go?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She said she found someone else. That it was over.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He looked in the mirror. Tears flowed from the windows into his soul. He wasn’t good enough for her, obviously. He laid down on the bathroom floor and curled up into a ball. A truncheon was digging at his sides.</p>
            <p class="text-center"><strong>pt. 7  -  law & order</strong></p>
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;His heart pounded as he went through the metal detector. He never thought that he would make it to this moment. But he was here. It was like a dream come true.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The man he came to see was sitting handcuffed. He was wearing an orange jumpsuit. One or two guards walked around the secure room. Luke walked up to him and then sat down.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Hi, Derek. My name is Luke Gosling, and I’ll be your new attorney.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Fucking finally, I’ve been here for seven months waiting for a lawyer worth half of a rat’s ass.” The orange man replied.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I’m sorry to hear that. Now let’s talk about your case.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Of course. So can you get me out of here?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I can’t promise anything. Looking at your file, it doesn’t look that great. They got good evidence against you. They have your damn blood on her, and a neighbor saw you smash her windshield in the morning. But I’ve worked with worse cases. So tell me everything, I need to know it for our defense. I don’t want to make it to the courtroom and hear the D.A. say some shit I never heard before. Now, give it to me straight.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, I’ll tell ya. So I was at the girl’s house, right? Well, this bitch starts insulting me, saying that I don’t do my share of work around the house and some other shit. It got pretty heated. And I did break her windshield. She was a bitch.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“And that’s it?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yeah, that’s it.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Let me ask you something. Do you ever feel bad for what you’ve done? Do you ever feel sorry?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Derek sat up when he asked this. “Are you my lawyer or my fucking mom? Shit. Besides, I can do whatever I want. Fuck the man.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Oh really. Do you really think this way?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Of course.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“And it doesn’t matter who it is? Even if it's your girlfriend or an innocent little boy?”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“No, the fuck not.”<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At this answer, Luke reached into his suit coat and pulled out a Smith & Wesson pistol. He aimed straight at Derek’s head.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Derek’s mouth dropped, but something in his eyes told Luke that he now knew who he was, that he was that little boy who he savagely abused twelve years ago.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“See you in hell.” Luke said defiantly.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Luke pulled the trigger, and six 9mm rounds went into Derek’s cheek, throat, and eyes. As soon as he did, every guard in the visitation room jumped on him. But it was too late. Derek, the man who Luke thought about every hour, was now a pool of blood on the ground.<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As Luke was being handcuffed on the cold concrete floor, a smile emerged.</p>
