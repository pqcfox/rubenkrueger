            <p><strong>3:02 A.M. 12/1/16</strong></p>

            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I watch snowflakes drift lazily down, accompanied by a horrific windchill. It is a frigid Baltimore night, and I cannot stop my violent shivering. And I cannot stop from looking over my shoulder.
                Normally I have a lookout, but the usual kid would never stand out here this late. So now I have to be my own lookout, glancing constantly to see if there is a cop, or a nosey neighbor. This combination of weather, bad luck and my health is driving me insane.
                No sane person would be in this seedy of a neighborhood, especially at this time of the night. And a junkie is hardly a rational thinker, as I have come to believe. Who else would wait at a street corner notorious for gang shootings?<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But circumstances force me to do so, in my tattered jeans and ripped hoodie no less. In between my bouts of coughing, I see someone who makes me breathe a sigh of relief. He is not someone who most people would be happy to see; in fact, most people would walk to the other side of the street if possible.
                He has a large frame, exaggerated by a puffy coat and baggy jeans. When he awkwardly walks towards me, he checks over his shoulder. When he does this, it exposes a tattoo of a serpent coiled around his neck. I wonder if it symbolizes a certain vice, reminding everyone of how his habit strangles him.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;He finally reaches me. Our conversations are always terse. This one is especially so, as I can barely speak between the clattering of my teeth. I hand him some crumpled up dollar bills, and he matches me with a small bag of rock. He shows a slight grin, exposing crooked teeth.
                I hurried away, eager to inject my catch. Just to be sure, I checked over my shoulder. As usual, I saw my drug dealer turn a corner and disappear.<br></p>

            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

            <p><strong>3:57 A.M. &emsp;&emsp;12/1/16</strong></p>

            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The uniformed man shined a mag-lite on the corpse. He called in a coroner, but it would be hours before one arrived. They were responding to many other calls in the city.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“It’s the third one this week,” his partner said scornfully.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Not a good time to be a dealer,” the other officer replied. Both officers illuminated the corpse’s face, exposing to the world the dead man’s crooked teeth.<br></p>

            <p>*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

            <p><strong>2:37 A.M.&emsp;&emsp;12/4/16</strong></p>

            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I paid extra for this bag, and it was totally worth it. I stayed high for days on one dose, way longer than normal.
                But the man keeps following me.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It started right after I shot up, with a shadow behind me which moved as soon as I turned to see the figure. There were other abnormalities as well…<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I can feel now an incredible burn all across my skin. It increases in intensity whenever I see the shadow. I had heard of inmates who were given lethal injections but were not properly anesthetized, and thus they felt the scorching potassium chloride coursing through their veins. I wonder how different my position is from theirs, a prisoner given one last injection.
                Worse than the burn is the sound of insects—buzzing, crawling and biting—I hear; these sounds are not coming from outside my body. I can picture in my mind thousands of grotesque creatures—some with wings, some with hairy legs, some with fangs—moving about inside of me. <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is so horrifying I can’t sleep, even though I haven't slept in the past three days.
                I wanted to get rid of the fucking insects so goddamn bad that I sprayed rat poison into my ears and mouth and nose. The pain from the poison is worse than the burn on my skin. The poison didn’t work (I found it in a dumpster), it just made the skin around where I sprayed it die.
                I am so fucking terrified that I am going to shoot up once more. I don’t even care if I die.
                Right now I am loading up my syringe. I’m having a hard time finding a fucking vein because recently my skin has turned an ugly shade of grey. Yes! I just found one. Before I had finished pushing the plunger down, I fucking saw a shadow out of the corner of my fucking eye.</p>

            <p>*	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*</p>

            <p><strong>Unknown Time</strong></p>


            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I woke up on a cloud. A woman older than me stood a couple of yards away from me. She asked if I wanted to dance with her. I hesitated; I was unsure, given that she was holding a red balloon and had a face similar to mine.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then the devil appeared. He asked if I wanted to dance. I said yes. I grabbed his hand and he twirled me around. We danced for so long I lost track of time. Then suddenly, his arm and hand turned into a serpent. The serpent wrapped around my neck and could not breathe. I kicked and struggled with all my might, but it was not working against his immortal powers.
                Then he said he would let me go if only I gave up syringes and instead ran to the woman with the red balloon. I again hesitated, and looked at the woman, who now was crying.
                The devil then wrapped around me tighter, and insects began to crawl all over my skin. They were the most disgusting things, with misshapen heads and bodies. They buzzed with great intensity and it echoed loud in my ears. Worse, they began to bite, and I felt the most intense burning sensation.
                The devil dragged me from the cloud and into places way deeper than I had fallen before from my addiction. I was afraid, but also angry, for I alone was to be blamed.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While I was being dragged, I kicked and screamed and punched and then screamed some more, but it did nothing. I saw my life flash before my eyes, and it was not pretty. I saw the first time I robbed someone for drug money; I saw the first time I injected heroin; I saw the day I died.</p>
