        <h3>by Ruben Krueger</h3>
        <div class="jumbotron">
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Earth is one huge turtle, as one Mandan creation myth goes, and one time it sank because the white men stuck a knife through its shell.
                Water flooded its back, but fortunately the
                tribe had built a tower on the lower bank of the Heart River, and thus was saved.
                The Mandan who told this to painter George Catlin could not imagine how this legend would become truth. This story—a story of destruction, a story of
                injustice—would begin with catastrophic torrents of water and ambitious government officials.</br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Nature responded to settlements and agriculture along the Missouri River with the devastating flood of 1943; Pick-Sloan was the bold mortal retaliation.
                A cooperation between the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Land Reclamation, the myriad of projects built in reaction to the flood became known collectively as the Pick-Sloan plan.
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To tame the capricious Might Mo, colossal dams were constructed. The crown jewel of the project was an earth-filled embankment dam in the heart of North Dakota. Coincidentally,
                the resulting reservoir would emerge at the heart of the Fort Berthold reservation.
                The Three Affiliated Tribes, the federally-recognized nation which lived there, would not lose without a war. This is a people which, threatened by extinction from smallpox in the nineteenth century,
                came together as one group, when they had been previously distinct tribes—the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara. The Battle of the Wabash, Tippecanoe, and Fallen Timbers were fought with bow and arrows, and muskets,
                yet the Three Affiliated Tribes fought just as hard in their struggle against the Garrison Dam. But the Garrison Dam was a fait accompli.
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Expensive suits and eminent domain gave the taking of the tribes’ land a veneer of civility and legality, but in truth this action was as justified as the Trail of Tears. The trauma of losing their ancestral
                homelands manifested itself through alcoholism, diabetes, and social disarray. The Tribes previously grew all their food and had a tight-knit community. But the Dam flooded all the lands suitable for agriculture,
                and members were swept away across the region during the haphazard relocation.
                The number of elders who remember what life was like before “The Great Flood” are dwindling, and are also the fluent speakers of Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara. Much like the Mandan creation story, the white men
                stabbed something in the back, and life for the tribes was drastically different as a result. Unlike the legend, however, after the 1953 completion of the Garrison Dam, there was no sanctuary to run to.
                Some tribal members could not learn to swim, and thus are forever drifting away from what is sacred.
